            cmd3 contains a ~/.cloudmesh/cmd3.yaml file.
            This command will add/delete a plugin for a given command
            that has been generated with cm-generate-command
            To the yaml this command will add to the modules

                - cloudmesh_COMMAND.plugins

            where COMMAND is the name of the command. In case we add
            a command and the command is out commented the comment
            will be removed so the command is enabled.

        yamlplugin add --package PACKAGE
        yamlplugin delete --package PACKAGE

            This command adds/delete the package name

                - PACKAGE.plugins

            To the cmd3.yaml file

        yamlplugin disable --command COMMAND
        yamlplugin disable --package PACKAGE

            sometimes it is beneficial to actually not delete the module
            from the yaml file but out comment. THis way it can using add
            will first check if it it out commended and remove the comment
            to enable it

    Example:

        yanlplugin add pbs
